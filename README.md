## Analyzing RNA-Seq data from TCGA

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare type of cancer developed in the bile duct, having poor prognosis and limited treatment. This work attempts to characterize CCA tumor data collected from TCGA-CHOL database.

For practice, difference between paired tumor and normal tissue's gene expression profile will be analyzed by following this vignette:
